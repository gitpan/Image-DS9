NAME
    Image::DS9 - interface to the DS9 image display and analysis program


DESCRIPTION

    Image::DS9 is an interface to the DS9 program developed by the
    Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's High Energy Astrophysics
    R&D Group.  DS9 is a flexible and feature laden image display and
    analysis program.  While targeted at the astronomical community,
    it is versatile enough to be used with success by others.

    Image::DS9 is in a very embryonic state; it does not support all
    of DS9's features, and the API may change.  It is being developed
    to interoperate with PDL.

    For details on DS9, including the source (and binaries for some
    platforms), please refer to

	http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/

DEPENDENCIES

    This module requires the IPC::XPA module to communicate with ds9.
    IPC::XPA is available from CPAN; it requires the XPA library
    available at

	http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/xpa/

    It requires DS9 v2.1. Due to a change in the colormap XPA access
    point, it is not compatible with older versions of DS9.  Sorry!

INSTALLATION

    This package has been tested on Perl 5.6.0, and xpa 2.0.3.
    It has been tested on Solaris 2.6 and Solaris 2.8.

    You will need to install IPC::XPA first.

    To compile, test and install Image::DS9,

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

    PLEASE NOTE! the tests will start up a DS9 in the background using
    system().  For some reason the first time the tests are run (and
    DS9 is started) the first test hangs after completion (at least on
    my system).  Interrupting the test and running "make test" a
    second time succeeds.

CHANGES

    See the Changes file for more details.

    0.13
    ----
    Image::DS9 is now GPL'd.

    There is a large number of changes since the last public release,
    0.09.  Substantially more of DS9's capabilities are now available.
    
    There are a few incompatibilities:

      - DS9 v2.1 has changed the colormap XPA access point to
	cmap.  Image::DS9 now required DS9 v2.1

      - the constants TRUE and FALSE have been removed, due to Export
        problems.
	
      - renamed T_Grid, T_Column, and T_Row to T_grid, T_column,
	T_row
