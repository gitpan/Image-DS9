Image::DS9 is an interface to the DS9 program developed by the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's High Energy Astrophysics R&D
Group.  DS9 is a flexible and feature laden image display and analysis
program.  While targeted at the astronomical community, it is
versatile enough to be used with success by others.

Image::DS9 is in a very embryonic state; it does not support all of DS9's
features, and the API may change.  It requires the IPC::XPA module to
communicate with ds9.  It is being developed to interoperate with PDL.

For details on DS9, including the source (and binaries for some
platforms), please refer to

IPC::XPA is available from CPAN; it requires the XPA library available
at
