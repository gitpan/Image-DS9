Revision history for Perl extension Image::DS9.

0.09  Fri Sep  8 23:31:03 EDT 2000
	- confused max index with number of elements in check
	  for correct number of arguments for scale( 'limits' )

0.08  Wed Aug  2 12:15:40 EDT 2000
        - made compatible with API change in IPC::XPA v0.04.
	- _Get() now more flexible about chomping buf and messages;
	- implemented res_wanthash attribute
	- implemented verbose attribute
	- most ops arrays available as useful ones as @xxx_ops_dbg
	- cleaned up ops stuff a bit to make less problematic to add stuff
	- queries now take into account whether in list or scalar mode
          and return either the hash or the value of {buf}, respectively
	- added iconify(), mode(), orient(), rotate().
	- made scale(), zoom(), and display() queryable

0.07  Thu May 11 13:48:37 EDT 2000
	- max_servers could default to zero if no servers
	  were running; this would cause problems later if
	  one was started up.  it now defaults to at least one.
	- $self->{res} is always updated after Set.
	- the frame show command was incorrectly implemented.

0.06  Wed May 10 13:24:39 EDT 2000
	- renamed frame ops once more
	- renamed file ops to filetype
	- removed tile() and blink()
	- move _Set() and _Get to Set() and Get(); no docs yet

	- returned buffers from Get are now chomped

0.05  Tue May  9 11:35:39 EDT 2000
	- added more frame op tags

	- added file method

0.03  Thu May  4 10:04:32 EDT 2000
